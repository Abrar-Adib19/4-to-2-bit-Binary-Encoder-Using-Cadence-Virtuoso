This project demonstrates the utilization of VMware Workstation and Cadence Virtuoso Software to create a 4 to2 Binary Encoder. The software enables the generation of a schematic, symbol, and layout for the specified project, building upon insights gained from prior experiments. The goal is to determine the feasibility of fabricating the designed components. The project's outcomes are validated through DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) tests conducted on each segment of the design. These tests ensure that the project yields optimal results suitable for both its intended functionality and eventual fabrication.
